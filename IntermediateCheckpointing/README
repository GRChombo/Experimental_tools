This folder contains the necessary files for intermediate checkpointing. These
files have been tested rigourously, but we have declared them experimental and
not included them in the main code since there are a lot of small mistakes one
may make (e.g. changing parameters when restarting from checkpoint is usually
possible in GRChombo, but can lead to significant problems with intermediate
checkpointing if the user is not aware of the dangers).

The principle behind this code is that intermediate checkpoint files also
include time interpolation polynomials, which can be used to fill ghosts cells.

If you want to use the files in this directory, you will have to change Chombo
with the appropriate setter and getter functions for the time interpolation
polynomials.
